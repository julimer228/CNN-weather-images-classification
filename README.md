# CNN-weather-images-classification

In this Jupyter notebook, you will find three CNN models. The first two models are designed for classifying images into two classes, making it a binary classification task. They differ in their output layers: the first model has a single output, while the second model has two outputs. In the first model, the output is a value between 0 and 1. Values closer to 0 are classified into the first class, while values closer to 1 are classified into the second class. The activation function in the output layer is the sigmoid function, and the loss value is set to binary_crossentropy.

In the second model, labels are encoded using one-hot encoding. Subsequently, they are transformed into categorical data, enabling their use in a model with two output neurons. Each output returns the probability of belonging to a specific class. A sample is classified into the class with the highest probability. The loss was set to categorical_crossentropy and the activation function was set to softmax. The third model, on the other hand, is configured to classify images into four classes. The loss was set to categorical_crossentropy and the activation function was set to softmax.
